> "Her Majesty Shirley has summoned you to fight in a grand tournament called in her honor - free tuition is the promised prize. Will you rise to the occasion?"

## Current RCOS Proposal

## Motivation

I wanted a simple, easy-to-learn local multiplayer game to play with my roommates at my apartment when we are bored. I also wanted it to be based on us and RPI to keep it interesting, and also to provide some nostalgia after we graduate. Emulating classic, 2D fighting games seemed like a sensible choice with my limited game dev experience and assumed relative simplicity of the genre. Obviously I was very wrong about the simplicity, but prototypes were so funny that I decided it was worth still attempting.
